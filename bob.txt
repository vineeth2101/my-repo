Hi, This is Vineeth
Now, whenever you     try to commit changes, this    script will run and check for trailing whitespaces in Python files. If it finds any, the commit will be aborted.

This is a very basic example, and you can modify and      extend the       script to include other checks or tasks as needed for your project.
